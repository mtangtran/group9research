eventually come up against trees in one form or another. However, due to their somewhat
complex nature and the multitude of algorithms that are used for inserting, deleting,
balancing, rebalancing and searching, it can get overwhelming for anyone. Many people learn
well by doing, and that’s where visualisers come into play; there are several online that can
help prospective students understand how the algorithms they’ve programmed work by using
nodes and animations. One of the most popular being this website made by David Galles at
the University of San Francisco which has visualisers for tons of algorithms. There are,
however, a few problems from the user experience part of it that hinder it as a learning tool.
One of the main issues with the visualiser is it is only that, a visualiser. There isn’t
any other learning tool that is built into it. It exists purely to show the user how data is input,
deleted and searched for in their selected tree structure. This means that the user needs to use
a supplemental application to aid in their learning, something that can get tedious and clunky
should the user have trouble understanding how the algorithms work. Our website aims to
combine this visualiser with proper lessons and quiz questions to create a multimedia
interface to aid the users in understanding their algorithms. The design of the UI will be
reworked so that elements are grouped together in a more cohesive way so they are not all
laid out on the bottom of the screen. Moreover, the input boxes will have their hidden
affordances removed in the sense that there won’t be any limit on the number of characters
that can be inserted into the trees. We will add explanations with code or pseudocode along
with the visualiser to aid in the user’s understanding of the particular algorithm they are
studying.</p><p>Additionally, there will be sections of the website that will allow for additional
features to allow the users to check their understanding of the concepts they’ve been taught.
There will be a quiz section where the users can reinforce what they’ve learned from playing
with the visualiser and reviewing the pseudocode lessons. Moreover, there will be a section
that the users can go to that where they can review specific algorithms in more detail, they
can see the time complexity analyses of an algorithm, as well as more in depth explanations
into how they work to aid in their learning should they have difficulty wrapping their head
around a new algorithm.</p><p>All of the above will vastly improve the user experience of the website; it will group
elements together more cohesively and hide elements under drop down menus to make the
overall interface much more appealing and organised; additional elements will be added to
support learning to make the effect of the visualiser much more potent allowing the user
complete their goal of learning in a much more efficient manner</p><p>When we were redesigning the application and designing new features, our design process had design challenges evident. We had to continuously evaluate the state and effectiveness of our User Interface (UI). A final UI was selected after multiple models were designed, created, and evaluated. Once the user interface was redesigned and approved, we had issues with multi-value input working faster than the animation code. The animation code had a delay inside to allow it to execute in the right amount of time. Altogether, these were some of the main design challenges we had present. </p><h2 id="navigational-map">Navigational Map</h2><h2 id="employed-design-principles">Employed Design Principles</h2><p>Gestalt laws of grouping
Closure
During our learning pages, a progress bar displays their progress partially and then fills up to the end. When they are at the end, the progress bar will go to the end. </p><p>Common fate
Our practice curriculum goes from left to right for the beginning and end. We start off with the introduction lessons at the left as the start. Then we provide the user practice sessions in the middle. Finally, we end with a multi-level quiz session to test their knowledge. This format goes in sync for each respective lesson. </p><p>Continuity
Our pages guide users in a vertical format they can read as a path. We have a vertical slider for guidance.</p><p>Proximity
Our menu guides users to group menu and quiz difficulty options. Similar components are grouped together, such as the information with insertion and deletion information with their respective diagram GIFs. </p><p>Similarity
Our project formats the information in a familiar format that allows presented information to be clickable. An example would be the distinct quiz buttons to ensure users understand which interaction they can do. </p><p>symmetry
During our quizzes, we try to maintain perfect symmetry in the quiz format. We have four possible quiz answers split up equally on each side. </p><p>Externalization of information
Our system has specific visual appearances for object use. Our multimedia content is supposed to be read and seen based on the information and video. Then our practice component has specific play and input fields to be visually displayed and entered. Altogether, these objects can be used appropriately by looking at their appearance.</p><p>Visibility
Users are not overwhelmed users with unnecessary alternatives. We provide only the information that users need. </p><p>Principle of familiarity
We allow users to enter manually one by one or by a multi-set entry. Users can add data to their desired preferences. </p><p>Affordance principle
The affordances are used when the movement of going forward and backward in the quiz section. Users are provided the back option on the left side and the forward option on the right side. </p><p>User interface affordance
Users can only pick mutually exclusive options. They can only select one option inside the quizzes, practices, and lessons at a time. </p><p>Static vs dynamic affordance
One static affordance that we present inside our project is static cues. We have buttons for pushing inside the quizzes and practice. </p><p>Constraints
We have physical constraints with the animation speed. We allow users to control the speed visually. 
We provide a non-physical constraint through menus that are psychological. We allow visible characteristics of something to suggest the action possibilities. </p><p>Chunking
The learning material is where multimedia content is separated into chunks for the user. Material is chunked close together and aligned in accordance with the Law of Proximity. </p><p>Mapping
The mapping of information is displayed distinctively on the learning and quiz pages. We group information into separate categories for specific quizzes and learning topics to allow distinct choices for the users. Then the user can pick one specific topic they can learn, practice, or evaluate themselves on. </p><p>Confirmation
Visual feedback is provided to users when they reset their input answers. They will be prompted to confirm their selection with an option of canceling the option if need be. </p><p>Progressive disclosure
Progressive disclosure is where we limit the amount of information to only necessary and requested. We present only one page at a time for the lessons, practice, and quizzes. </p><p>Consistency
Our app has multiple areas of consistency. Learning pages are consistent in their presentation of multimedia information. Then as users progress to the practice section they will use the same practice user interface tool for the visualization. As they get enough confidence, users will attempt to complete the quiz.</p><p>Transfer
We go through the traditional learning process by presenting information in a left-to-right format. The app begins with an introduction at the start, practice simulations next, and at the end are the evaluations. Together, this presents information like how a textbook presents information. </p><p>Garbage in - garbage out
We control the quality of system input by not allowing users to enter data except by clicking on the learning and quiz pages. The input quality will not go down if the user can only click on the pages. 
There are practice lesson pages where users can enter data for their respective data structures. </p><p>Control
We plan to allow users to control the quiz difficulty and the pace of their input data. These two features allow users to see their expertise and individual preferences on how data enters the system. </p><p>Feedback
We provide feedback in our system through feedback messages. The messages have a known time/progress to users inside the learning pages. In addition to a progress message, we have a feedback message on the specific entries on each data structure entry and operation.  </p><p>Causality
We try to add causality once an operation is complete. For the start of the quiz, once the users finish the question, they are suggested possible options for where to go next. As the next step occurs, users can see their animation complete or end after the last added input. Finally, once the quiz is over, a score is given back to users on their work. </p><p>Hick’s Law
We limit the number of possible choices for the data structures, quiz options, and paths to four. This limited selection allows users to make simple and quick decisions for simple tasks.</p><h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2><ol><li>Visibility of System Status</li></ol><p>We use visual displays to inform the users where they are inside the system. After each system feature is finished, we will guide the user on the next steps in the process.</p><ol><li>Match Between the System and the Real World</li></ol><p>Our system tries to follow traditional words, and concepts of traditional data structure learning websites, courses, and textbooks. </p><ol><li>User Control &amp; Freedom</li></ol><p>We allow users to go back and forth between distinctive areas on the page. There are backward and forward interfaces to allow users to progressively go back and change their answers in the quizzes or input in the practice section. This allows the user to feel empowered with freedom and confidence. </p><ol><li>Consistency and Standards</li></ol><p>For our learning application, each feature has a consistent and standard content layout across each unique page. An example would be the learning pages. We use the same exact layout of the introduction, insertion, and deletion order. Every subsection has a block of text and a gif visual to explain and demonstrate the process. This formatting allows us to follow external consistency with other sites and internal consistency with our other topics inside the learning section. </p><ol><li>Error Prevention</li></ol><p>We provide users with a way to change their answers through backward buttons to undo their perceived mistakes. There will be a warning button to clear all answers with a prompt asking users if they really want to reset their answers.</p><ol><li>Recognition vs. Recall in User Interfaces</li></ol><p>Our system only provides the traditional interface of menus, actions, and elements. We provide the appropriate amount of information to the user. There are buttons that play the visualization, animation speed, and insertion/deletion/search fields. </p><ol><li>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</li></ol><p>Users can select whatever option they want. They are unrestricted from starting at the learning sections. Any component, either practice or quizzes, can be accessed regardless of when users enter the system. </p><ol><li>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</li></ol><p>We only display the relevant information that users want from their selected feature. We do not mix and match quizzes, practice, and learning material into one section. </p><ol><li>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from</li></ol><p>Errors
Users can recover from errors by resetting the inputs/answers that they have. </p><ol><li>Help &amp; Documentation</li></ol><p>We will have multimedia tutorials where users can see how to use the system in terms of practice and quizzes. Each tutorial will have a concise and concrete list of steps to perform. This guide allows users to see how to use the system if they are not confident.</p><h2 id="resources-and-references">Resources and References</h2></div></div></div></div>
