Tree algorithms, encompassing insertion, deletion, balancing, rebalancing, and searching, can be complex and many find them overwhelming. Many students benefit from hands-on learning experiences, and visualizers provide an effective way to understand these algorithms through animations. One popular visualizer is a <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html">website</a> by David Galles at the University of San Francisco, which offers visualizations for numerous algorithms. However, this tool contains design flaws, has dated design, and is missing some key features, all of which hinder its effectiveness as a learning tool, forcing users to rely on supplemental applications for their learning. Our redesign aims to address those weaknesses and provide a more comprehensive learning experience.</p><p>We integrated the visualizer with lessons and quiz questions to create a multimedia interface, eliminating the need for supplemental applications. The design of the user interface (UI) has been reworked to be clearer and more intuitive. Elements are grouped together more cohesively, and some are hidden under drop-down menus for a cleaner interface. We improved navigation by adding menus for smoother transitions between different tools.</p><p>An important improvement happens in the input boxes themselves. They no longer have hidden affordances, and they can accept a wider range of characters, restricted to integer values only to avoid confusion. Furthermore, we have improved the visual design, updated it with React, and added a learning module to enhance the emotional and affective experience.</p><p>During the redesign process, we faced several design challenges, such as evaluating and iterating on the UI design, leading to the final version being selected after multiple models were examined. We also encountered issues with multi-value input working faster than the animation code, which required adjustments to the animation delay.</p><p>We have incorporated explanations, code, and pseudocode alongside the visualizer to facilitate a deeper understanding of the algorithms being studied. A quiz section allows users to reinforce their learning, while a dedicated section for reviewing specific algorithms offers detailed explanations and time complexity analyses.</p><p>These improvements significantly enhance the user experience by creating a more organized and visually appealing interface. Additionally, the added learning support features amplify the visualizer’s effectiveness, enabling users to achieve their learning goals more efficiently. Despite the challenges faced during the redesign, our redesigned website offers a more intuitive and comprehensive learning experience for users seeking to master tree algorithms.</p><h2 id="navigational-map">Navigational Map</h2><p>This is the lesson plan storyboard:</p><button><span class="idyll-display">Show lesson storyboard</span></button><div style="display:none"><img src="./static/images/0.png" alt="lessonPlan"/></div><p>This is the quiz plan storyboard:</p><button><span class="idyll-display">Show quiz storyboard</span></button><div style="display:none"><img src="./static/images/1.png" alt="quizPlan"/></div><p>This is the visualizer storyboard:</p><button><span class="idyll-display">Show visualizer storyboard</span></button><div style="display:none"><img src="./static/images/2.png" alt="visualizer"/></div><h2 id="employed-design-principles">Employed Design Principles</h2><p>
We have <span class="idyll-dynamic">24.00</span> design principles incorporated into our project: </p><h3 id="1.-closure:">1<!-- -->. Closure:</h3><p>We applied the Gestalt law of closure by incorporating a progress bar on our learning pages. This progress bar provides users with an overview of their learning progress, helping them understand how far they have come and how much further they need to go. This improves the user experience by creating a sense of achievement and motivation as users work through the learning materials.</p><h3 id="2.-common-fate">2<!-- -->. Common Fate</h3><p>To enhance the user experience, we designed our practice curriculum to follow a left-to-right layout, maintaining consistency and cohesion. We begin with introductory lessons on the left, followed by practice sessions in the middle, and conclude with a multi-level quiz session on the right. This allows users to easily understand the sequence of steps they need to follow to complete the course.</p><h3 id="3.-continuity">3<!-- -->. Continuity</h3><p>We ensured continuity in our design by guiding users through the content in a vertical format. A vertical slider helps users navigate the learning materials seamlessly, providing a clear and consistent learning path.</p><h3 id="4.-proximity">4<!-- -->. Proximity</h3><p>We applied the Gestalt law of proximity by grouping similar components together in our menu. For example, insertion and deletion information are displayed alongside their respective diagram GIFs, making it easier for users to find and understand the information they need.</p><img src="./static/images/designPrinciples/spacingAndControl.png" alt="spacing"/><h3 id="5.-similarity">5<!-- -->. Similarity</h3><p>To improve usability, we formatted our content in a familiar and consistent manner, allowing users to easily recognize and interact with clickable elements, such as quiz buttons.</p><h3 id="6.-symmetry">6<!-- -->. Symmetry</h3><p>In our quizzes, we maintained symmetry by displaying four possible quiz answers equally distributed on each side. This balanced layout enhances the user experience by creating a visually pleasing and organized interface.</p><h3 id="7.-externalization-of-information">7<!-- -->. Externalization of Information</h3><p>We designed our system with specific visual appearances for each type of object, making it easy for users to understand their intended use. For example, multimedia content is designed to be read and viewed, while practice components feature clearly identifiable play and input fields.</p><h3 id="8.-visibility">8<!-- -->. Visibility</h3><p>To avoid overwhelming users, we focused on providing only the necessary information and tools, ensuring a streamlined and straightforward experience.</p><h3 id="9.-principle-of-familiarity">9<!-- -->. Principle of Familiarity</h3><p>We enabled users to input data according to their preferences by allowing manual entry, either one-by-one or in multi-set format.</p><h3 id="10.-affordance-principle">1<!-- -->0<!-- -->. Affordance Principle</h3><p>We utilized affordances in our design, such as providing back and forward navigation options in the quiz section, helping users understand how to navigate through the content.</p><h3 id="11.-user-interface-affordance">1<!-- -->1<!-- -->. User Interface Affordance</h3><p>We designed our interface so users can only interact with one option at a time in quizzes, practices, and lessons, ensuring a clear and focused experience.</p><h3 id="12.-static-vs-dynamic-affordance">1<!-- -->2<!-- -->. Static vs Dynamic Affordance</h3><p>Our project includes static affordances like buttons for interaction in quizzes and practice sections, making it easy for users to understand and interact with the interface.</p><img src="./static/images/gifs/animationSpeed.gif" alt="Alt Text"/><h3 id="13.-constraints">1<!-- -->3<!-- -->. Constraints</h3><p>We implemented physical constraints by allowing users to control the animation speed, enhancing the user experience. We also introduced psychological constraints through menus, guiding users to interact with the interface in specific ways.</p><h3 id="14.-chunking">1<!-- -->4<!-- -->. Chunking</h3><p>We separated learning material into manageable chunks and grouped related content together, following the Law of Proximity, making it easier for users to understand and digest the information.</p><h3 id="15.-mapping">1<!-- -->5<!-- -->. Mapping</h3><p>We organized information on learning and quiz pages into distinct categories, allowing users to make clear choices about the topics they wish to learn, practice, or evaluate.</p><h3 id="16.-confirmation">1<!-- -->6<!-- -->. Confirmation</h3><p>To prevent unintended actions, we provide visual feedback and prompts for users to confirm their input selections or to cancel their actions if necessary.</p><h3 id="17.-progressive-disclosure">1<!-- -->7<!-- -->. Progressive Disclosure</h3><p>We designed our content to display only necessary and requested information at any given time, presenting one page at a time for lessons, practice, and quizzes, reducing cognitive load on users.</p><h3 id="18.-consistency">1<!-- -->8<!-- -->. Consistency</h3><p>Our application maintains consistency throughout its various sections, such as learning pages with uniform multimedia presentations, practice sections using the same user interface tool for visualization, and quizzes following a consistent format. This ensures a coherent and predictable user experience, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the content.</p><h3 id="19.-transfer">1<!-- -->9<!-- -->. Transfer</h3><p>We designed our application to follow a traditional learning process, similar to how a textbook presents information. The app starts with an introduction, followed by practice simulations and evaluations at the end. This familiar layout helps users better understand and engage with the learning materials.</p><h3 id="20.-garbage-in---garbage-out">2<!-- -->0<!-- -->. Garbage In - Garbage Out</h3><p>To maintain input quality, we restricted user data entry to specific areas, such as learning and quiz pages. By limiting input options, we ensure that the quality of the system’s input remains high.</p><h3 id="21.-control">2<!-- -->1<!-- -->. Control</h3><p>We designed our application to give users control over quiz difficulty and the pace of data input. These features allow users to tailor the learning experience to their individual expertise and preferences.</p><img src="./static/images/quizDifficulty.png" alt="quizDifficulty"/><h3 id="22.-feedback">2<!-- -->2<!-- -->. Feedback</h3><p>We incorporated feedback messages to inform users of their progress within the learning pages. Additionally, we provided feedback on specific data structure entries and operations, ensuring that users understand the results of their actions.</p><h3 id="23.-causality">2<!-- -->3<!-- -->. Causality</h3><p>Our design establishes causality by providing clear outcomes and next steps following each operation. For instance, when a user finishes a quiz question, we suggest possible next actions. Similarly, after adding input to an animation, users can see the completed or final state.</p><h3 id="24.-hick’s-law">2<!-- -->4<!-- -->. Hick’s Law</h3><p>To simplify decision-making for users, we limited the number of choices available for data structures, quiz options, and learning paths to four. This streamlined selection process allows users to make quick and efficient decisions.</p><h2 id="detailed-heuristic-evaluation">Detailed Heuristic Evaluation</h2><h3 id="1.-visibility-of-system-status">1<!-- -->. Visibility of System Status</h3><h4 id="1.1-progress-tracking">1<!-- -->.<!-- -->1 <!-- -->Progress Tracking</h4><p>We use visual displays to inform users of their current position within the system. For example, we include a progress bar on learning pages, practice sessions, and quizzes, giving users a clear sense of their progress and how much more they need to complete. Additionally, we provide visual cues such as color changes, animations, and tooltips to communicate the state of buttons and interactions.</p><h4 id="1.2-next-steps">1<!-- -->.<!-- -->2 <!-- -->Next Steps</h4><p>Upon completion of a task or feature, we guide users on the next steps in the process. For instance, after finishing a quiz question, we suggest potential actions, such as reviewing previous questions, moving to the next question, or accessing additional learning resources.</p><h4 id="1.3-slow-response-time">1<!-- -->.<!-- -->3 <!-- -->Slow Response Time</h4><p>An unfortunate side effect of adding the ability to add multiple nodes at the same time, we had to increase the response time significantly to ensure the animation works well (also related to point 2.3 in this list). This delayed response time between inputs and visual feedback could lead to user frustration and a diminished learning experience.</p><h3 id="2.-match-between-the-system-and-the-real-world">2<!-- -->. Match Between the System and the Real World</h3><h4 id="2.1-familiar-terminology">2<!-- -->.<!-- -->1 <!-- -->Familiar Terminology</h4><p>Our system employs traditional terminology and concepts found in data structure learning websites, courses, and textbooks. We avoid using jargon or technical terms that may confuse or alienate users, instead opting for language that is clear, concise, and relatable to users with varying levels of expertise.</p><h4 id="2.2-real-world-mapping">2<!-- -->.<!-- -->2 <!-- -->Real-World Mapping</h4><p>We designed our system’s features to align with real-world processes and workflows. The learning materials, practice sessions, and quizzes are organized in a manner that mimics the progression of a traditional textbook or course, enabling users to feel more at ease while navigating the system.</p><h4 id="2.3-dated-language-framework">2<!-- -->.<!-- -->3 <!-- -->Dated Language Framework</h4><p>The current code is based on dated code libraries, however to improve this aspect would require rewriting the entire code, from scratch. This dated framework means the system is clumsy and appears dated. An overhaul of the entire system using a modern framework would have helped us in improving performance, optimizing the algorithms and visualizations to reduce response times, create a smoother user experience, and modernize the overall look and feel of the system.</p><h3 id="3.-user-control-&amp;-freedom">3<!-- -->. User Control &amp; Freedom</h3><h4 id="3.1-navigation-flexibility">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->1 <!-- -->Navigation Flexibility</h4><p>We allow users to move freely between distinct areas of the system, including learning materials, practice sessions, and quizzes. Backward and forward navigation options are provided, enabling users to revisit previous sections or change their responses at any time.</p><h4 id="3.2-undo-functionality">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->2 <!-- -->Undo Functionality</h4><p>To further empower users, we include undo functionality that allows them to correct perceived mistakes or revert to a previous state. This enhances the user experience by fostering a sense of control and confidence while navigating the system.</p><h4 id="3.4-missing-features">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->4 <!-- -->Missing Features</h4><h5 id="3.4.1-missing-direct-interaction-feature">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->4<!-- -->.<!-- -->1 <!-- -->Missing Direct Interaction Feature</h5><p>There is no way to interact with the tree directly by pressing on various nodes (for example, right-clicking to have a drop-down menu which would allow to delete a node, or print the path to it, etc.). This feature cannot be added without first modfying the entire code to work with a modern library for the purpose of animation and otherwise. Despite it, having such a feature would have given users the opportunity of a more hands-on experience when learning about tree structures, and would have increased the emotional investment.</p><h5 id="3.4.2-missing-tree-merging-feature">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->4<!-- -->.<!-- -->2 <!-- -->Missing Tree Merging Feature</h5><p>The ability to merge two trees. This could be an essential function for users who want to explore advanced tree manipulation techniques. Incorporating this feature will provide a more comprehensive learning experience for advanced users.</p><h5 id="3.4.3-missing-advanced-tree-building-quiz">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->4<!-- -->.<!-- -->3 <!-- -->Missing Advanced Tree Building Quiz</h5><p>An advanced tree building quiz where the user gets a question such as “how would a tree look if we add 6, 8, 1, 3, 11, 5, in this order, to an empty tree?”. Such questions would help deepen users’ understanding of tree structures and their manipulation and provide a more challenging and engaging learning experience for users who have already mastered basic tree concepts.In the current framework, adding this feature would be somewhere between very difficult.</p><h5 id="3.4.4-missing-tree-saving-feature">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->4<!-- -->.<!-- -->4 <!-- -->Missing Tree Saving Feature</h5><p>Storing the existing tree to memory so the user will have the option of using it when opening the page the next time (likely through cookies). This would allow users to save their progress and continue working on their tree structures at a later time. Adding this feature could improve user satisfaction and provide a more personalized learning experience.</p><h5 id="3.4.5-missing-tree-comparison-feature">3<!-- -->.<!-- -->4<!-- -->.<!-- -->5 <!-- -->Missing Tree Comparison Feature</h5><p>The ability to compare various algorithm and trees is missing.
